# SCC workspace

One Git repository contains four independently deployable Next.js artworks:

| App | Workspace root | Production URL | Local HTTPS URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SCC archive | `apps/scc` | existing SCC project | `https://<local-hostname>:2000` |
| C-VAL | `apps/c-val` | `https://c-val.vercel.app` | `https://<local-hostname>:2001` |
| ddong-meong | `apps/ddong-meong` | `https://ddong-meong.vercel.app` | `https://<local-hostname>:2002` |
| Goldfishes | `apps/goldfishes` | `https://goldfishes.vercel.app` | `https://<local-hostname>:2003` |

The apps share dependency installation, certificates, tooling, and the modular
Socket.IO relay without sharing their Next.js route or asset namespaces.

## Runtime

Local development uses Node.js `26.5.1` with npm `11.17.0`, pinned in `.nvmrc`
and `.node-version`. Package operations use pnpm. Vercel builds use Node
`24.x` because Vercel does not yet support Node 26. The package engine range is
`24.x || 26.x`: local Node 26 satisfies it without warnings, while Vercel
selects its currently supported Node 24 runtime.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with the pinned Node version active:

```bash
pnpm install
```

The user-owned HTTPS development workflow for all four apps is:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

It exposes the four app URLs in the table, the socket relay at
`https://<local-hostname>:4000`, and the local root certificate at
`https://<local-hostname>:4000/cert`. Focused workflows start one app plus the
same relay:

```bash
pnpm dev:scc
pnpm dev:c-val
pnpm dev:ddong-meong
pnpm dev:goldfishes
```

C-VAL's canonical routes are `/1/...` and `/2/...`; ddong-meong's are `/1`
through `/4` and their existing child routes; Goldfishes uses `/default`,
`/2d/1`, and its dated archive paths. SCC's former `/c-val/...`,
`/ddong-meong/...`, and `/goldfishes/...` URLs remain compatibility redirects.

Agents must not start the development server. See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) and
the [HTTPS/socket harness notes](./docs/harness/https-and-sockets.md) for the
operational rules.
