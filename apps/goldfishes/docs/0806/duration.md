# 0806 duration

Date: 2026-08-06 · Route: `/0806/duration`

**Question:** can a click become Bergsonian duration instead of a stationary target? Forked from `0806/compositional-grid`: each selected 1×1 cell records creation time and grows downward from fixed present layer 700. Earlier clicks are longer; the top view keeps their footprint coincident with the selection grid, while orbit reveals history. Fish stay in a narrow band above the present layer. Selection, fish field, atlas, full orbit, controls, and sparse grammar remain invariant.

`Composition > 2×2+ blocks` is off by default. When enabled, it creates a locally offset 2×2 visual companion sharing time/media history; only 1×1 cells attract fish. The field plane is hidden. Instanced pillars/media tops add instances, not meshes; live length is computed per frame and capped at 4,800 world units (a transform bound, not FPS evidence).

`Field > media strata` starts on. Every media change closes an interval into a retained layer below the fixed present; disabling it clears retained history, and re-enabling starts a new history. Strata use a 2,048-instance ring-buffer mesh and elapsed-time shader motion; at most 64 transitions enter a frame and one upload range merges them. Image speed is 0–24 (default 12); growth is 0–1,000 world units/s (default 1,000). COMPANY is default: transparent tiles discard empty pixels and one-time conversion makes black marks white; other atlases are opaque.

Open question: what growth rate reads as duration rather than imperceptible increment or graphic scale?
