# PC / 0910 / image-search

`/pc/0910/image-search`: a single desktop Google Images-like surface in place of the 0908 mobile grid. The query is selected at random from the locally copied 21-term technology vocabulary every 100–1000 ms. Each transition enters a 58 ms local loading phase, then replaces the thumbnail-bearing suggestion chips and six-column result field together.

question: can the familiar desktop image-search grammar keep a parameter change legible when the change is faster than an ordinary search session?

baseline: `/pc/0908/variations`, specifically its `google` mobile-results surface and technology keyword inventory.

mutation: remove the many phone slots and retain one desktop Google Images-like result page. The active technology query controls the chip vocabulary, 24-image sequence, image proportions, titles, source labels, and their six-column composition.

invariants: the dated experiment is self-contained; its query list, image metadata, timing, and styles are all local. It does not import 0908 implementation, fetch Google results, or imply live/personalized search. Entering one of the listed exact query terms into the search input selects it immediately; random cycling resumes afterward.

evidence: an authenticated desktop Google Images result frame was inspected at 1397×744 on 2026-09-10: dark `#20242a` surface; a 92px logo at x=148; a 727×52px search field at x=283; a 48px category strip; thumbnail-bearing refinement chips; then six roughly 216px image columns with 10px gutters. Image cards keep their own ratios and each carries a title and source row. The scheduler chooses a new index only after a random 100–1000 ms delay and skips hidden documents or a focused search input. Query, chips, card keys, ratios, titles, and sources all derive from the same active index, so one visible frame cannot mix two topic states. The sampled public thumbnail/editorial URLs are fixed local data, not current Google rankings.

The visual source boundary is the inspected desktop Google Images result state plus the existing 0908 local Google surface. This is an editable reconstruction, not a replay of Google's product behavior or ranking. Static typechecking is the pending verification; no local server was started.
