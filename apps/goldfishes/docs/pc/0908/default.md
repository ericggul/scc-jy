# PC / 0908 / default

`/pc/0908/default`: one phone per goldfish; local sample news cycles through keywords independently. `/pc/0908` lists dated experiments, matching the screen branch. Reference: Internetinental `market-economy/screen/grid/7` + `screen/5`.

- `components/pc/0908/default/model/config.ts`: 90 slots, 18×5 at 1920×1080; count/minimum rows remain configurable. Each 390×844 phone scales as one unit. At 50% presence, about 45 phones are visible on average.
- `model/field.ts`: stable fish IDs, cadence, bounded stories. `news/`: replaceable website. No network or screen coupling yet; conceptual rules await instructions.
- Each phone independently samples keyword presence (50%) at its jittered update time; absence fades the phone out while preserving its grid slot and history. Presence probability and cadence jitter live in config; appearance/disappearance transitions stay at 800ms independently of simulation speed.
- Bottom controls adjust count (1–192), minimum rows, fitted size, gap, presence and speed in place; presence 100% exposes every slot. Layout changes retain phone IDs/history; controls occupy their own row outside the phone stage.
- Static checks only; browser appearance and timing unverified.
