# Goldfishes archive

Code: `apps/goldfishes/components/screen` and `apps/goldfishes/components/pc`; registry: `components/experiments.ts`. The registry is authoritative for routable experiments and archive navigation. `screen/default` is the promoted baseline; dated routes are archival and must not be repurposed.

For a route change, read its document, the specific modules being changed, and the registry. Read [onboarding](./agent-onboarding.md) when creating or substantially changing a Goldfishes experiment; consult [history](./research-and-rendering-history.md) only for a relevant rendering, measurement, or historical-decision question.

Each experiment is a complete local copy: no cross-experiment implementation or ledger imports. Existing public images may be addressed by URL; only immutable company logos are a shared collection (`public/assets/goldfishes/assets/company-logos`). Asset URLs must exist inside this independently deployed app; after changing a collection, run `pnpm audit:goldfishes-assets`.

To add a trial, copy the nearest complete directory into `components/{screen,pc}/MMDD/short-name`, mutate only that copy, register its ISO date and concise proposition, and record the essential decision and open question. Re-open the registry and this index immediately before a surgical patch: parallel work is expected.

Legacy URLs remain available as aliases: `/default`, `/2d/1`, and dated routes resolve to their `/screen/...` counterparts; `/3d/1` → `/screen/default`; `/3d/2`, `/0804/1` → `/screen/0804/tube`; `/3d/3`, `/0804/2` → `/screen/0804/pillars`. Goldfishes has no client Socket.IO protocol; add one only for a concrete experiment under `socket/experiments/<experiment>/` with its own prefix and room.
