# 0908 overlay-2d-2

Route: `/0908/overlay-2d-2`. Separate fork of `0908/overlay-2d`.

Question: can the school’s accumulated individual movement make its attention legible without the Instagram-field influence edges?

Baseline: `0908/overlay-2d` — 72 Canvas2D goldfish above the original DOM/SVG field.

Mutation: remove the visible SVG influence layer and its controls. Each fish writes a thin, persistent gold path to its own Canvas2D trace buffer; the current fish are redrawn above that buffer.

Invariants: the bubble field, 2D fish anatomy, 24Hz bounded loop, 72-fish attention model, pixel-ratio cap, surface controls, and pointer-inert overlay remain local copies of the baseline. Traces rescale with the canvas; they clear only with the experiment itself.

Static typecheck and asset audit only; browser observation remains open. The unresolved question is whether long unattended accumulation becomes materially dense enough to obscure the keyword field.
