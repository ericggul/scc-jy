# 0908 overlay-2d-4

Route: `/screen/0908/overlay-2d-4` (alias `/0908/overlay-2d-4`). Date: 2026-09-08.

Standalone copy of overlay-2d-3 exposing every fish × every keyword grid cell, including empty and out-of-range cells. The simulation and persistent traces remain unchanged. Goldfish are fixed as the agent glyph. `all cells` toggles the relationship layer without resetting state; `line straight / curve` switches only its geometry. Keyword propagation keeps separate controls. No arrowheads. The `hangul` surface option is omitted in this experiment.

All fish/cell links are yellow. Faint lines mean no live force or retained candidate evaluation, not a force acting from every cell. Candidate dotted lines use the actual selection score normalized by that fish's strongest evaluated score; candidates are evaluated only at the model's reconsideration times and retained until the next evaluation; removed/replaced cells invalidate cached scores immediately. Short dotted avoidance lines use actual anticipatory repulsion or collision penetration strength. Selected-target dashed lines use absolute radial drive relative to its clamp (not net acceleration, and not always inward). Solid contact lines represent equal per-fish contact contributions; aggregate contact changes keyword lifespan and propagation probability. Where mechanisms overlap, contact, selection, avoidance, then candidate determine the displayed style. These different weight scales are not interchangeable physical units.

Dense typed buffers, counting-sort buckets and cached cell positions avoid per-pair and per-frame `Path2D` allocation. Eight strength bins across five relation states require at most 40 Canvas2D strokes per frame, with no pair truncation. Strength rises over roughly 0.1 seconds and falls over roughly 0.25 seconds instead of blinking at model updates. Dashes use shorter gaps. Curve mode applies stable cubic Bézier curvature per fish/cell pair. Work still scales with fish count × grid cell count; on-device FPS is unmeasured. Live links never accumulate in the trace canvas.

Validation: app typecheck and scoped lint; pure baseline comparison checks unchanged fish motion and attention accounting. No browser verification requested.

The shared fish/relation canvas, trace canvas and propagation SVG all sit at z-index 0 below the keyword grid at z-index 1. This requires no extra canvas, clipping pass or frame loop. Candidate persistence regression checked 7,852 between-evaluation fish frames including target refreshes; baseline motion and contact remained identical.
