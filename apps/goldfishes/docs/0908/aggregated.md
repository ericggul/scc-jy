# 0908 aggregated

Route: `/0908/aggregated`. Experimental; implemented and statically checked, with rendered comparison and device performance unverified.

Question: can Instagram/4's short-lived keyword transmission field become the spatial attention field of the Goldfishes school?

Baseline: SCC `sns/instagram/4` (keyword identities, circular rings, spacing, palettes, transmission timing and curves), Goldfishes `default` (naturalistic instanced anatomy and perimeter gathering), and `0806` (one continuous scene under a movable camera).

Mutation: keywords and fish occupy one Three.js scene. Newly activated keywords attract the school; attention persists briefly as novelty fades. Direct selection renews a keyword. A top orthographic view retains the source composition; orbit reveals fish above the keyword plane.

Invariants: dated baselines remain untouched; dark ground, keyword ordering and typography, ring palette controls, size/gap controls, optional labels and directed edges. This is a standalone central visual experiment.

Drive concept note: not yet located through the connected account; requested its link. Repository concept review is available, but review of that note remains pending.

The operative relation follows `0806`'s common scene and attention plane: keyword activation, visible lifetime and attraction share state/time. It does not import the duration/decay variants' historical pillars. The local story system retains its 210 ms propagation step, 760 ms viewing interval and 300 ms leaving interval. A fresh occurrence supplies a strong novelty term that decays over 1.7 seconds; distance, persistent individual affinities and target loyalty distribute the school. Fish reconsider at staggered 260–680 ms intervals, gather at circular perimeters, align with neighbors and separate through a spatial hash. Viewing/leaving reduce attraction to 28%/7%; empty removes it. Once a cascade fully empties, one new occurrence restarts the field.

Click a keyword to renew it. Alt-drag/right-drag orbits; the wheel zooms. Top resets to exact orthographic projection; oblique exposes fish depth above the same plane. The source's palette, label, icon-size and gap controls are retained, with pause added. Keyboard focus exposes a keyword selector/renew action. Reduced motion and hidden documents stop autonomous model/render updates; elapsed simulation time also stops.

The rendering uses Three.js r185's WebGPURenderer and TSL per-instance atlas sampling, opacity and individual ring clipping. Rings, glyphs, labels, ribbons and naturalistic fish share one camera and depth buffer. Geometry and picking use the same `storyCenter` function. Canvas-generated atlases preserve the local vocabulary (115 terms), conic palettes, glyph proportions and font settings without cross-app assets. Appearance is intended to reproduce Instagram/4 from above; canvas text rasterization, approximated transition easing, label clipping at the 28 px label slot, and ribbon tessellation still require a visual comparison. No pixel-parity claim has been established.

Workload bounds: 100 fish in eight instanced anatomical batches; at most 2,048 keyword cells in three additional batches (6,944 total component instances including fish); 120 curves in one reused buffer with 20 segments each. Transparent double-sided fins may use additional passes: at most 16 scene draws with labels. Glyph/label atlases are 4,096×2,048 each, ring atlas 1,024²: 68 MiB RGBA without mipmaps. Geometry/buffers are reused and disposed on unmount; atlases are not uploaded per animation frame. DPR is at most 1, backing storage is capped at 4,194,304 pixels, autonomous rendering at 24 Hz, with no shadows, postprocessing or compute dispatch. Counts, rate, draw and memory limits are architectural bounds, not measured FPS or total GPU-memory figures. WebGPU's automatic WebGL2 backend remains separately unobserved.

Checks: Goldfishes typecheck and scoped ESLint pass; six pure tests cover deterministic identity, resize mapping, activation timestamps, gathering, dense bounded motion, retargeting/empty release and novelty preference. No server start or browser/runtime interaction was performed.

Routing follow-up: the user reported a 404 on this route. The current generated manifest includes it, but Next's development server returns cached static paths while regenerating them in the background. The catch-all now permits request-time parameters; its registry lookup still rejects unknown experiments. This removes the static-path allowlist as a second registration gate. The reported request itself was not traced, and successful browser navigation after this change remains unverified.

Implementation references checked 2026-09-08: [InstancedMesh](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/InstancedMesh.html) for reusable geometry/instance buffers, [WebGPURenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/WebGPURenderer.html) for backend/lifecycle, and [OrthographicCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/OrthographicCamera.html) for the top-view coordinate contract. Installed r185 node-material source supplies per-instance TSL and RGBA vertex-color behavior.

Visual correction after user feedback: the initial fish scale of 0.92 was too small, and DPR 1 plus 128 px atlas tiles produced an unsatisfactory image on the user’s display. Fish scale is now 3, matching `0806/side-view`; perimeter clearance/spread and separation were increased for the larger anatomy. Atlas tiles are now 256 px (68 MiB texture budget). Typecheck and the six school tests pass. Raising the actual display DPR remains pending explicit HTTPS browser-observation authorization under the repository GPU policy; atlas changes alone do not resolve that display-resolution limitation.
