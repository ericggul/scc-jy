# Goldfishes working contract

Start with the target route's document and modules plus `components/experiments.ts`; follow only relevant links. For a new or substantial experiment, also read root `AGENTS.md` and the SCC [tinkering](../../../docs/foundations/tinkering.md) guidance; use [design](../../../docs/foundations/design-guidelines.md) for a new/materially redesigned UI and [history](./research-and-rendering-history.md) only when its rendering or historical decisions apply.

## Method

Goldfishes tests one change in the relation between a school, its attention field, participant input, and viewpoint. Keep a recognizable working parent; change one operative material, geometry, topology, temporal rule, or input relation; compare the result directly. A new directory is a standalone copy, not a candidate for shared abstraction. Public image URLs are allowed, but data lists selecting them remain local; company logos are the sole shared immutable collection.

Before coding, write:

```text
question: what relation is tested?
baseline: closest complete parent
mutation: exact changed behavior/material/geometry/input
invariants: every unrequested visual and interaction contract
evidence: observable or measurable result
```

Unmentioned properties are invariants. A geometry change does not authorize new locomotion, camera, palette, controls, layout, or media scheduling. A prompt saying “same as” calls for local reproduction unless it explicitly asks for shared architecture.

## Visual and technical floor

- The changed relation must read without labels, metrics, scenery, water decoration, badges, panels, or technical chrome. Leva is collapsed authoring UI, never the artwork's wrapper.
- Geometry, hit areas, targets, projections, and resize behavior must share coordinates. 3D must be perceptible in the relevant view, not merely use 3D primitives.
- Preserve legible fish anatomy, heading, tail motion, gathering, and collision behavior. Materials must not stretch, seam, flip, crop unintentionally, or flicker identity.
- Stable identities stay stable across redraw, resize, and theme changes unless the experiment explicitly resamples them. Keep workload bounded; distinguish an architectural bound from an FPS result.

## Archive workflow

1. Inspect status, the registry, target date folder, and untracked files. Treat all concurrent work as owned.
2. Copy the closest complete experiment to `components/{screen,pc}/MMDD/short-name`; make changes inside it only.
3. Register one date, route, and concrete phrase in `experiments.ts`; add the matching concise document. A dated route is permanent. Promotion deliberately replaces `default` while retaining the dated origin.
4. Record implementation facts, observation conditions, failed alternatives, and unresolved questions. Do not turn an inference into evidence.
5. Re-open shared registry/index files immediately before patching. Do not reorder, normalize, adopt, delete, or report other work.

Completion means one intelligible question, a standalone implementation, preserved invariants, a resolved visible relation, and an honest record of result and uncertainty.
