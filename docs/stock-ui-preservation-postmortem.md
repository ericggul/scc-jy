# Stock UI preservation postmortem

This document records a concrete agent failure during the migration of the
stock experiment from ten data records to three mobile-driven synthetic
stocks. It is durable guidance for future agents working anywhere in this
repository.

## 1. The request was expanded without authorization

The requested change concerned the data model: reduce the live screen from ten
stocks to `ALPHA`, `BETA`, and `GAMMA`, initialize each at `100.00`, and map the
three calibrated mobile axes directly to their price slopes. The request did
not ask for a new screen design.

The failed implementation treated a new data context as permission to invent a
new instrument-panel UI. It replaced the established stock cards, information
hierarchy, chart proportions, and securities display language. That was a
scope violation, not merely an aesthetic disagreement.

For an existing experiment, the current interface is an active contract. A
change request must first be divided into:

- Explicit changes: records, values, formulas, routes, device roles, or named
  visual changes.
- Invariants: every existing visual, structural, interaction, and language
  choice that the user did not ask to change.

In this case, only the stock count, names, value calculation, and grid shape
were mutable. Card geometry, typography, spacing, colors, chart styling,
responsive behavior, and the surrounding page treatment were invariants.

## 2. The repository's visual and domain language was ignored

The stock interface already established a precise vocabulary:

- Symbol and company name in the left information column.
- A tabular price such as `100.00`.
- Securities change language such as `+1.23  +1.23%`.
- Green for gains and red for losses.
- A dark area chart with glow and a fine foreground stroke.
- Fixed responsive card height, padding, radius, and chart proportions.
- No explanatory labels, badges, status chrome, or implementation notes.

The failed screen exposed `%/s`, an internal integration unit. Even when that
unit accurately described the model, it did not belong in the stock screen.
The mobile controller may expose `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma`; the screen must
translate their effect into the established securities language of price,
absolute change, percentage change, color, and chart shape.

An experimental repository does not mean arbitrary redesign. The experiment
is often the insertion of a new behavior into an existing form. A surprising
input should produce a disciplined mutation of the established artifact, not
erase the artifact's identity.

## 3. Verification covered math but not fidelity

The failed implementation verified that `alpha = -45` integrated from `100.00`
to `55.00` after one second. That proved only the numerical half of the task.
It did not prove that the result still looked and behaved like the stock
experiment.

Completion required an explicit fidelity audit:

- Exactly three stocks are rendered.
- The layout changes only from `2 x 5` to `1 x 3`.
- Each card uses the original height, internal columns, padding, radius,
  background, and shadow.
- The original `StockChart` implementation is reused.
- Price and change use the original securities formatting.
- No `%/s`, sensor labels, connection indicators, explanatory text, or new
  control surfaces appear on the screen.
- The original ten-stock `/stock/default` remains independent and unchanged.
- Mobile values alter data only; they do not alter visual composition.

Tests, TypeScript, and formula smoke checks are necessary evidence, but they
cannot establish visual preservation by themselves. Source comparison and,
when explicitly authorized, browser screenshots must be part of the evidence.

## Required checklist for future agents

Before editing an existing experiment:

1. Read the current implementation and its scoped documentation.
2. Write down the explicit requested changes.
3. Write down the unmentioned UI and interaction invariants.
4. Identify reusable visual primitives before creating new components.
5. Keep model units and debugging terms out of the rendered UI.

Before reporting completion:

1. Compare the new and original component geometry directly in source.
2. Search for newly introduced visible labels and chrome.
3. Verify record count, layout shape, and domain formatting separately from
   the mathematical behavior.
4. Verify the archived/default experiment remains isolated.
5. State any fidelity item that could not be checked visually.

## Corrective implementation

The corrected stock screen reuses the original `StockChart` and the exact card
class contract from `components/stock/default/dashboard.tsx`. It renders three
cards in a one-column container sized to the original desktop card width. The
screen displays only symbol, company name, price, securities change, and the
original chart. The exact slope integration remains confined to
`components/stock/1/axis-model.ts`.
