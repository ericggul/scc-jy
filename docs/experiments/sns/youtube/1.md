# SNS YouTube 1

Route: `/sns/youtube/1`

## Intent

This is a mobile-first, responsive long-form video platform built from
YouTube's information hierarchy. It is not a generic media dashboard or a
vertical short-video viewer: discovery, playback, channel context, comments,
queueing, and personal library actions remain connected so a viewer can move
from a recommendation to a sustained viewing session without losing their
place.

### Design procedure

1. **Participant situation:** a person is deciding whether to begin, continue,
   save, discuss, or queue a video while moving between a phone and a larger
   browser.
2. **Primary parameter:** the viewer's current video context — especially what
   is playing, how much has been watched, and what can follow it.
3. **Perceptual job:** make the distinction between a new recommendation, an
   unfinished video, an active video, and an item saved for later immediately
   legible.
4. **Interaction job:** provide direct paths to play, pause, search, save,
   subscribe, comment, share, add to queue, and resume.
5. **Wrapper justification:** a video platform's established grammar is
   appropriate because the participant is navigating time-based media, its
   source, its queue, and its discussion — not because "video" needs a
   media-themed dashboard.
6. **System family:** the phone home screen is one continuous stream of full
   width 16:9 previews and compact metadata rows. Wide screens use that exact
   record structure in a recommendation grid. White content surface, dense
   black type, neutral action pills, a red playback/progress signal, and the
   same channel identity remain consistent across views.
7. **Removal test:** there are no promotional hero cards, decorative metrics,
   fake live indicators, or ornamental dividers. Red remains only for the play
   mark, live state, and watched-time progress; removing any of those would
   reduce playback legibility.

The only expressive gesture is the real time-axis: a thin red progress line
appears where it helps the viewer resume or control a video. It is not used as
a generic accent.

## Screen and interaction map

The route deliberately combines the following YouTube-derived navigation and
viewing states rather than presenting a single static feed:

1. Continuous home recommendation feed
2. Mobile bottom navigation
3. Desktop expanded and collapsed sidebar
4. Mobile slide-out navigation
5. Explore category previews and trending feed
6. Subscribed-channel avatar row and latest feed
7. Search entry, recent-search fallback, working video/channel/recent-upload filters, and channel results
8. Video overflow menu
9. Watch player: autoplay, pause/play, mute, elapsed time, direct scrubber, speed settings, download feedback, and full screen
10. Description collapsed and expanded
11. Mutual-exclusion like/dislike, save-to-Watch-later, share, download, and subscription states
12. Share sheet with clipboard link copying; comment sorting, likes, composer, and persistent threaded replies
13. Continuous up-next feed and queue
14. Notification and account popovers
15. Desktop create menu with upload, live, and post actions
16. Channel Home, Videos, Playlists, and interactive Community tabs
17. Personal library, history, watch-later list, and playlist detail
18. Persistent mini-player with independent pause/play after leaving the watch view
19. Video deep links through `?v=<video-id>`, with browser back/forward restoration

## Performance and data

- All creators, videos, comments, collections, and playlists are deterministic
  local model data. There are no video, social, or search API calls.
- Remote media uses configured Unsplash image optimization, `next/image`,
  accurate alt text for thumbnails, lazy loading for recommendation imagery,
  and responsive `sizes` values.
- IDs are stable in the model layer and are used as React keys. User-created
  comments receive a monotonic local ID.
- The player is a visual interaction model, not a media fetcher; its progress,
  state, queue, comments, likes, subscriptions, saves, and overlays remain
  client-local.
- Selecting a video writes `?v=<video-id>` to the current route, resets the
  document to the top, and starts its local playback state immediately. Direct
  links and browser back/forward restore the selected video; leaving the watch
  view removes the parameter. Shared links use that current URL. Playback time
  is tracked as seconds, rendered as a real `m:ss` or `h:mm:ss` value, and can
  be changed through the player scrubber.
- Both home and watch-page recommendations begin with a local batch and extend
  in further batches as the viewer approaches the document bottom, reusing
  deterministic records with stable per-item keys. The mobile bottom
  navigation is hidden while watching so it cannot cover the continuous
  recommendation feed.
- The `/sns` route layout emits its own static viewport configuration with
  `maximumScale: 1` and `userScalable: false`; its wrapper also sets
  `touch-action: pan-x pan-y`. Pinch-to-zoom is therefore disabled for every
  SNS route without changing the rest of the app.

## Files

- `components/sns/youtube/1/model/types.ts`
- `components/sns/youtube/1/model/data.ts`
- `components/sns/youtube/1/screen/icons.tsx`
- `components/sns/youtube/1/screen/navigation.tsx`
- `components/sns/youtube/1/screen/video-card.tsx`
- `components/sns/youtube/1/screen/index.tsx`
- `components/sns/youtube/1/index.ts`

The dynamic SNS route remains a thin registry/switch. The interface stays in
the YouTube component family and does not change the existing feed or
navigation experiments.
