Short description: **Pillars fork with a side-on initial view.**

## Preservation contract

- **Question:** how do the existing attention pillars read when the participant
  begins from their side rather than from above?
- **Baseline:** `0804/pillars`, copied as a complete standalone experiment.
- **Mutation:** the initial and reset camera begin side-on. `Camera > auto
  rotate` moves through a full horizontal orbit while resetting elevation to the
  side-view plane on every frame; `Camera > rotation speed` controls its rate.
  `Motion > speed` is a separate local movement-time control with a default of
  `1.0`; the initial goldfish scale is `3.0`.
  Image-atlas transitions use a brief eased crossfade whose duration remains a
  fixed portion of each image's speed-derived playback interval.
  Slider drags retain their displayed ranges, while direct numeric entry accepts
  the entered finite value without applying that range as a clamp. The renderer
  still limits fish count to its fixed instance capacity.
  `Field > show floor` controls the WebGL field rectangle; it is hidden by
  default while its mathematical plane remains available for pointer mapping.
- **Invariants:** pillar geometry, fish model and motion, selection behavior,
  manual orbit and zoom, media atlases, styles, and full-screen composition all
  remain identical to `0804/pillars`. Automatic rotation is disabled by default
  and respects reduced-motion preference.
- **Evidence:** the new camera and floor defaults have static verification only;
  no browser review has been performed.

The directory owns its model, renderer, atlas implementations, media-source
ledgers, screen, and styles. It imports no implementation from another
Goldfishes experiment, so the subsequent trial can change without affecting the
Pillars baseline.
