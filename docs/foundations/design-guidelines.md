# Visual design

Read for new interfaces or material redesigns. Existing UI contracts remain
invariants when only data, behavior, math, or transport changes.

## Form follows the participant's task

Identify who acts, what parameter/relation they must notice or change, and why
the proposed interface makes that action legible. A subject name such as bank,
AI, or news does not justify a themed dashboard. Record the rationale briefly
in working notes or the experiment document; no separate proposal is required.

If the interaction is not yet proven, begin with a neutral surface, clear
typographic hierarchy, the primary parameter, necessary secondary information,
and whitespace. Add a visualization only when it makes temporal or relational
change legible. Functional separators need an actual information boundary;
decorative dividers and image captions are not defaults. Images use accurate alt text.

Do not substitute faux technical chrome for an interface concept: arbitrary
dark/neon palettes, glow, gradients, giant numbers with tiny labels, ornamental
charts/gauges, fake LIVE states, revision codes, badges, and process footers.
These are not a universal ban on domain conventions; each element needs an
informational, interactive, or perceptual job. Remove elements whose deletion
does not weaken that job. Do not imply precision, liveness, or functionality
that the system lacks.

## Preserve operational grammar

References contribute hierarchy, density, alignment, semantic color, controls,
and expectations. Copying their palette alone is insufficient. `stock/2`'s
terminal grammar belongs to its task, not every experiment with data.

Parametric interfaces change a value within the reference's active semantic
slot. Keep spreadsheet lyric tokens in ordinary unmerged cells in the intended
row; never replace them with overlays, titles, badges, or floating lines.
Edge-aligned references meet the viewport's top/left edges without outer padding.
Hyper-real spreadsheet work retains chrome, formula bar, headers, selection,
tabs, and grid. Détournement requires a recognizable original coupling and a
legible transformation, not arbitrary data in a familiar-looking shell.

For complex-systems experiments, derive form from the exact phenomenon.
Existing routes are history, not a palette/layout template. Begin perceptual
simulations with the field alone; add controls/text only when the participant
needs them. Direct-field or keyboard actions must remain discoverable and
accessible. Do not default to serif titles, corner counters, graph notation,
pause/reset controls, or distributed metrics.

## Typography and multi-device work

Texts with the same role share exact family, size, weight, tracking, line height,
casing, and responsive behavior through a common class/token/selector. If color
is the intended difference, change only color. Compare paired labels when
editing their styles; do not invent hierarchy for visual balance.

Across devices, preserve a coherent grammar while allowing differences justified
by actual roles, parameters, or observation tasks. Make propagation, transitions,
and mutual influence perceptible; individual screen spectacle must not obscure
the relation. System-node names alone do not warrant separate visual identities.

Fixed-format artifacts scale internal typography, spacing, and controls
with the outer container at a usable visual size. Non-scrollable pages fit their
required content inside the viewport. Reuse established primitives and present
values in the experiment's domain language, not simulation/debug terminology.
